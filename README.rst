django-superform
====================

Imagine you want to have a view that shows and validates a form and a formset.
Let's say you have a signup form where users can enter multiple email
addresses. Django provides formsets_ for this usecase, but handling those in a
view is usually quite troublesome. You need to validate both the form and the
formset manually and you cannot use django's generic FormView_. So here comes
**django-superform** into play.

.. _formsets: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/topics/forms/formsets/
.. _FormView: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/ref/class-based-views/generic-editing/#formview

Here we have an example for the usecase. Let's have a look at the
``forms.py``::


    from django import forms
    from django_superform import SuperModelForm, FormSetField
    from myapp.models import Account, Email


    class EmailForm(forms.ModelForm):
        email = forms.EmailField()

        class Meta:
            model = Email
            fields = ('email',)


    EmailFormSet = modelformset_factory(EmailForm)


    class SignupForm(SuperModelForm):
        username = forms.CharField()
        emails = FormSetField(EmailFormSet)

        class Meta:
            model = Account
            fields = ('username',)


So we assign the ``EmailFormSet`` as a field directly to the ``SignupForm``.
That's where it belongs! Ok and how do I handle this composite form in the
view? Have a look::


    def post_form(request):
        if request.method == 'POST':
            form = PostForm(request.POST)
            if form.is_valid():
                account = form.save()
                return HttpResponseRedirect('/success/')
        else:
            form = PostForm()
        return render_to_response('post_form.html', {
            'form',
        }, context_instance=RequestContext(request))


No, we don't do anything different as we would do without having the
``FormSet`` on the ``SignupForm``. That way you are free to implement all the
logic in the form it self where it belongs and use generic views like
``CreateView`` you would use them with simple forms. Want an example for this?

::

    from django.views.generic import CreateView
    from myapp.models import Account
    from myapp.forms import SignupForm


    class SignupView(CreateView):
        model = Account
        form_class = SignupForm


    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        url('^signup/$', SignupView.as_view()),
    )

And it just works.
